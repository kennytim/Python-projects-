# StackOverflow Survey EDA
![](stack.png)
## Description
This Python project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in any data analysis project as it helps us understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the data before applying any modeling or statistical techniques. By exploring the data visually and statistically, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions about further analysis or preprocessing steps.
Features
Load and preprocess data: The project provides functionality to load data from various sources, such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or databases. It also includes preprocessing steps like handling missing values, data cleaning, and feature engineering if necessary.
Summarize and visualize data: The project enables the generation of summary statistics and descriptive information about the dataset, including measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and more. It also allows the creation of visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to better understand the data distribution and relationships.
Feature selection: The project provides functions to perform feature selection based on statistical methods, such as correlation analysis or mutual information. This helps in identifying the most relevant features for further analysis or modeling.
 In conclusion , the project was focused on me expressing some of the skills i acquired using python programming language and answering some of the problem statements I developed from the dataset
