## Description
This Python project is focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in any data analysis project as it helps us understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the data before applying any modeling or statistical techniques. By exploring the data visually and statistically, we can gain valuable insights and make informed decisions about further analysis or preprocessing steps.
